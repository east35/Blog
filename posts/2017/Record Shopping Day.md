Each month I spend far more money than I should on a dead medium, but I just can’t help myself when it comes to overt displays of hipster-douchedom. I’m an avid collector of vinyl records and have been since I was 10 when my dad gave me a few Black Sabbath and ELO records (and a few Village People records he insisted where his sister’s). Since then I’ve hauled what felt like hundreds of pounds of wax up and down stairs, jammed the backseats of compact cars (ruining the rear suspension of one 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer), and into my girlfriends apartment when we moved in together. She loved that…

I typically go through genre binges and this month has been all about classic “dad-rock”.

*Dreamboat Annie* Heart
Not much needs to be said about one of the greatest classic rock albums of all time. Fellow guitarists can share in the absolute obsession with perfecting the intro to ‘Crazy on You’. I’ve been searching for this album for a few years now. The show Transparent must have had a hand in the price surge because I could never find an original pressing for under $30 (I scored this copy for $14).

*The Red and The Black* Jerry Harrison
I’m a massive Talking Heads fan. David Byrne is a lifelong artistic hero of mine, which I’ll save for another blog post. My first reaction to this record was it sounded like a compilation of all the weird, micro-rhythmic bits within Talking Heads tracks. These small moments that create their unique sound (think of that drum intro to ‘Burning Down the House’ or synth-scratching in ‘Seen and Not Seen’). This is heavily saturated with those moments. I nearly lifted the needle in protest but I pushed through and gave it another listen the next day, and like all great albums that leave an imprint, it took me few times to ‘get it’. Excellent record, definitely recommend to any TH fan.

*Greatest Hits* Waylon Jennings
My girlfriend Morgan bought this for us both to enjoy (she’s a huge fan). Mostly needed this to top-off the collection of Waylon 33’s.

*Zammuto* Self Titled
Not a classic, but highly unexpected to find and at $10 I couldn’t refuse. The Books breaking up was a tragic day in my circle while in college, but we were blessed with a new release late 2012 by Nick Zammuto. Pitchfork summed up the transformation of sound, using the term ‘hypnotherapy’. Nick is creating new sounds by literally inviting new instruments.
