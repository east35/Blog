description: How Exploratory Design Helped Shift a Platform’s Creative Direction
category: Case Study
---

In 2016, **Indeed faced a perception problem**.

Despite massive adoption, the product *looked and felt* closer to Craigslist than a modern, trustworthy career platform. For users making high‑stakes decisions about jobs, resumes, and employers, this visual and experiential gap mattered.

My role was to **reimagine Indeed’s mobile experience**—not as a shippable redesign, but as a **creative product exploration** that asked a simple question:

> *What would Indeed look like if trust, clarity, and confidence were the primary design goals?*

This work was never intended to be built directly. Instead, it served as a **directional artifact**, influencing product and creative strategy across the organization.


## The Core Challenge: Trust

Job searching is deeply emotional and vulnerable:
- Users share personal information
- They evaluate life‑changing opportunities
- They need confidence in both employers *and* the platform itself

At the time, Indeed’s experience suffered from:
- Visual inconsistency
- Dense, web‑era layouts
- Low perceived credibility
- Minimal emotional reassurance

The challenge wasn’t usability alone—it was **belief**.


## Design Goals

The exploratory work focused on three core goals:

### 1. Increase Perceived Credibility
The interface needed to feel:
- Modern
- Calm
- Intentional
- Professional without being corporate

Visual clarity was treated as a trust signal.

### 2. Reduce Cognitive Load
Job seekers are already overwhelmed.

The design emphasized:
- Clear hierarchy
- Fewer competing actions
- Strong typographic rhythm
- Predictable navigation patterns

The experience guides users instead of confronting them.

### 3. Signal Care and Competence
Small details matter when users are anxious:
- Clear error states
- Gentle validation
- Thoughtful spacing
- Human‑centered copy tone

The product needed to feel like it was *on the user’s side*.

## Key Explorations

### Candidate Details

The candidate view was rethought to feel:
- Structured
- Respectful of personal data
- Easy to scan without reducing people to fields

This reframed candidates as individuals—not rows in a database.

### Company Reviews

Company reviews were redesigned to emphasize:
- Legibility over density
- Consistent presentation across companies
- Reduced visual noise from branding

In some explorations, company banners were intentionally removed to keep focus on *content over marketing*.

### Resume Creation

Resume creation is one of the most anxiety‑inducing moments in job searching.

The redesigned flow focused on:
- Step clarity
- Immediate feedback
- Reduced form intimidation
- Clear privacy signaling

Errors are framed as guidance—not failure.

### First‑Time Experience

The first‑time home experience was designed to:
- Explain value quickly
- Set expectations clearly
- Encourage exploration without pressure

Instead of throwing users into search immediately, the experience establishes context and reassurance.

### Job Search & Details

The job search and details screens were reimagined to provide clear, scannable information while reducing visual clutter.

## Why This Wasn't Meant to Ship

This work wasn’t a proposal for a single redesign.

It was:
- A **north star**
- A conversation starter
- A way to visualize what “trust” could look like at scale

Exploratory design like this creates shared language across design, product, and leadership—without the constraints of immediate feasibility.

## Impact

While none of these screens shipped directly, the work:
- Influenced visual and interaction direction
- Helped shift internal conversations around trust and perception
- Contributed to a broader move away from web‑2.0 aesthetics
- Clarified the role of design in shaping user confidence

Sometimes the most valuable design work isn’t what launches—it’s what **changes how teams think**.

## What I Took Away

- Trust is a design material, not a feature
- Restraint can be more powerful than novelty
- Exploratory work has real impact when framed clearly
- Designing for belief requires empathy, not polish alone

## Closing Thoughts

Reimagining Indeed reinforced an idea I still return to often:

> Products don’t earn trust by asking for it—they earn it by how they behave.

This project wasn’t about pixels for production. It was about showing what *care* could look like in a system used by millions at pivotal moments in their lives.
