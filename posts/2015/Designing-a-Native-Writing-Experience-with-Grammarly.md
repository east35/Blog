During my time working with **Grammarly**, I focused on designing a **native, cross-platform writing experience** built around Grammarly’s writing-checking system at its core. The goal was simple but ambitious: make Grammarly feel *invisible*—present everywhere writers need help, without interrupting flow.

This work spanned **macOS, iOS, and iPadOS**, and required close collaboration between design, engineering, and platform teams to ensure performance, consistency, and deep OS integration.

## The Design Challenge

Most writing tools treat grammar and clarity checks as an *overlay*—something that sits on top of text. My role was to rethink that model and design an experience where:

- Writing assistance feels **native**, not bolted on  
- Feedback appears **in context**, not in modal interruptions  
- The system scales from **phone to tablet to desktop**
- Writers stay in flow, even while revising heavily

This meant designing not just UI, but **interaction models**, cursor behavior, selection mechanics, and document structure.

## Core Principles

### 1. Writing First
The interface prioritizes text above everything else. Controls fade away when not needed, and the system avoids persistent chrome that competes with the writing surface.

### 2. Feedback Without Friction
Grammarly suggestions are integrated directly into the editing experience—surfacing at the cursor, within selections, or contextually nearby, rather than pulling users away into side panels.

### 3. Platform-Native Behavior
Each platform follows its own conventions:
- macOS embraces keyboard-driven workflows and windowed layouts
- iOS optimizes for touch, selection handles, and compact controls
- iPadOS bridges both, supporting multitasking and split views

## Document Structure & Navigation

Long-form writing demands strong structure. I designed a **dynamic table of contents** that allows writers to:

- Navigate large documents instantly
- Reorder sections with drag-and-drop
- Maintain orientation without breaking focus

The TOC adapts to screen size and input method, working equally well with mouse, keyboard, and touch.

## Cursor-Centric Editing

A major focus was designing around the **cursor**, not panels or buttons.

- Suggestions appear where attention already is
- Selection actions are contextual and lightweight
- Editing tools stay anchored to text, not screen edges

This approach reduces cognitive load and makes Grammarly feel like a natural extension of writing itself.

## Writing Modes & Focus

To support different writing states, I designed multiple **writing modes**, including a **focus mode** that minimizes distractions and emphasizes rhythm and flow.

- UI elements fade intelligently
- Typography and spacing adapt to reading vs writing
- Writers can move seamlessly between drafting and revising

## Cross-Device Consistency

Designing for macOS, iPhone, and iPad meant thinking in **systems**, not screens.

- Shared interaction patterns, adapted per platform
- Consistent Grammarly feedback behavior everywhere
- Layouts that respond to size classes and orientation

The result is an experience that feels cohesive, whether you're editing a paragraph on your phone or revising a chapter on a Mac.

## What I’m Most Proud Of

- Making Grammarly feel **built-in**, not layered on
- Preserving writer flow while delivering powerful feedback
- Designing systems that scale from short notes to long manuscripts
- Bridging platform conventions without compromising consistency

## Closing Thoughts

Writing tools succeed when they *disappear*. This project pushed me to think deeply about attention, interruption, and craft—how software can support writing without demanding it.

Designing this native Grammarly experience reinforced my belief that the best productivity tools don’t shout. They whisper—right when you need them.
