## **Find & Try**

Volvo's test drive service. The manufacturer & dealership relationship is a strange symbiosis that exists primarily due to dealership lobbying (think Tesla storefronts where you can't actually buy a car). Volvo's main concern is that a customers journey typically begins at the dealership and the brand has almost no control over the experience. A test drive is the first moment a potential customer comes into contact with their product so the brand wanted to develop its own test drive intermediary. 

I worked with Volvo's F&T product manager to develop the test drive sign up experience that exists today:

F&T work was [showcased at 2019's Superbowl LIII](https://www.media.volvocars.com/us/en-us/media/pressreleases/248144/footballs-biggest-night-led-to-40000-virtual-test-drives-in-the-all-new-volvo-s60) during a commercial break. 

### **Concierge**

Another strategy to get customers in the cockpit of a Volvo was to physically deliver the car wherever the potential customer was located (within a supported area). We experimented with 'mid-test drive' features like guided tours and recommended routes using the Sensus infotainment system.
