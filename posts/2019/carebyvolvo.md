## Care by Volvo

CbV is Volvo's premier car subscription platform. Similar to a lease with insurance included and flexible packages. I led a team of designers to craft the subscription flow that exists today:

### Multi-Cycle

Tested in German dealerships, project Multi-Cycle was a program launched to include certified used vehicles as a part of the Care by Volvo subscription model. We developed three main viewpoints: mobile, tablet, and desktop. Each viewpoint used Figma's brand new feature (at the time) auto layouts to illustrate flexibility between main viewpoints. 

The project spanned the complete user journey from discovery through transaction.
