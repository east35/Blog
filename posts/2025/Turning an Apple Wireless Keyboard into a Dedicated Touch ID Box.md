**Turning an Apple Wireless Keyboard Into a Dedicated Touch ID Box**

Touch ID on macOS is one of those “tiny convenience, huge quality-of-life” features. Unlocking sudo prompts, approving password manager fills, authenticating installs… it’s quick, secure, and habit-forming.

The only catch: on desktops and non-Apple keyboards, Touch ID is tied to the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID. Apple doesn’t sell a standalone Touch ID puck, and the sensor won’t work without Apple’s keyboard controller because of Secure Enclave pairing.

So instead of waiting for Apple to make the product I want, I made it myself: I hacked a wireless Apple keyboard into a small, desk-friendly Touch ID box.
