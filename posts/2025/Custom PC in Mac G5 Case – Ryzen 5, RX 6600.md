This project started as a fun side build. I had a few quality parts left over from previous PC builds, and when I found an old Mac G5 case at a local recycling center, I couldn’t resist giving it new life. The G5’s aluminum design is iconic, and I wanted to see what it would take to modernize it internally without losing the aesthetic.

Most of the components—CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, cooler—are brand new or nearly new, purchased in the last couple of months. I went the extra mile with airflow and acoustics using Noctua fans and a great cooler, so it runs super quiet. The PSU was modded to fit cleanly into the original Mac G5 power supply shell for a seamless look.

This was equal parts tech experiment and passion project—and it turned out better than I expected. Now I’m moving on to another build and would love to see this one go to someone who’ll appreciate the blend of modern hardware and old-school Apple design.
