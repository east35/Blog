## About
I'm Jim Jordan, a digital product designer and hardware tinkerer based in Austin, Texas. Over the past decade, I've led design teams and shipped products used by millions.

Currently, I'm Principal UX/UI Design Researcher for athenaPatient at athenahealth, leading product design across our patient-facing web and native platforms. Since launching in March 2023, athenaPatient has grown to over 1 million monthly active users—transforming athenahealth from a clinician-only platform into a patient-first experience.

Previously, I designed Credit Karma's core marketplace experiences, envisioned PayPal's first mobile NFC payments platform, helped establish Volvo Cars' first American UX team, and explored how AI would reshape Dell's product ecosystem. When I'm not designing, I'm building small form factor PCs, reading science fiction, or automating my home.
