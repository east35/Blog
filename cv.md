## About

I'm Jim Jordan, a Principal Product Designer and hardware hacker based in Austin, Texas. I've spent the last decade leading design teams and shipping products that millions of people use every day.

Currently, I'm the Principal for the athenaPatient zone at athenahealth, designing all patient-facing platforms including web and native experiences. Since launching athenaPatient in March 2023, we've grown to over 1 million monthly active users—fundamentally shifting athenahealth from a clinician-only platform to a patient-first experience.

Before that, I helped Credit Karma grow their design team from 6 to 30+ designers, launched Facebook's F8 developer conference, lead the first American design team at Volvo Cars, and explored how AI will reshape Dell's product ecosystem over the next decade.
When I'm not designing, I'm probably building small form factor gaming PCs, falling off rock walls, or tinkering with home automation projects that inevitably break in interesting ways.
